| [0. Use a private key](./0-use_a_private_key) | Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to your server using the private key `~/.ssh/holberton` with the user `ubuntu`.  |
| [1. Create an SSH key pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair) | Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.  |
| [2. Client configuration file](./2-ssh_config) | Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an `SSH `configuration file for the local `SSH client`, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your `SSH client` configuration in your answer file.  |
| [3. Let me in!](./) | Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party. Add the `SSH public` key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.  |
| **advanced** | **Description** |
| [4. Client configuration file (w/ Puppet)](./4-puppet_ssh_config.pp) | Letâ€™s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, weâ€™d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.  |
