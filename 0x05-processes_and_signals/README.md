| [0. What is my PID](./0-what-is-my-pid) | script that displays its own `PID`.  |
| [1. List your processes](./1-list_your_processes) | script that displays a list of currently running processes.  |
| [2. Show your Bash PID](./2-show_your_bash_pid) | Using your previous exercise command, write a `Bash` script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the `PID` of your `Bash` process.  |
| [3. Show your Bash PID made easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy) | Write a `Bash` script that displays the `PID`, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash`.  |
| [4. To infinity and beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond) | script that displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely.  |
| [5. Kill me now](./5-kill_me_now) | We killed our `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process using `ctrl+c` in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this. Write a Bash script that kills `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.  |
| [6. Kill me now made easy](./6-kill_me_now_made_easy) | script that kills `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.  |
| [7. Highlander](./7-highlander) | Bash script that displays: To `infinity and beyond` indefinitely With a `sleep 2` in between each iteration `I am invincible!!!` when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal Make a copy of your `6-kill_me_now_made_easy` script, name it `67-kill_me_now_made_easy`, that kills the `7-highlander` process instead of the `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` one.  |
| [8. Beheaded process](./8-beheaded_process) | script that kills the process `7-highlander`.  |
| **advanced**  | **Description**  |
| [9. Process and PID file](./100-process_and_pid_file) | script that: Creates the file `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` containing its `PID`, Displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely, Displays `I hate the kill` command when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal, Displays `Y U no love me?!` when receiving a `SIGINT` signal, Deletes the file `/var/run/holbertonscript.pid` and terminates itself when receiving a `SIGQUIT` or `SIGTERM` signal
